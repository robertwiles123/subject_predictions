Notes for future:
Look for code that I am constently reusing between files (the encouding) and build a python package so i don't have to update it in several places
On each, create a dictonary from the col names with numbers assosicated - show dict to user and let them pick which catagories they want to use for the relevant file
Change the cleaning file to simplify the names, doing this will mean changing the code in other places, but will make further code, and future CSV easier to fill
Complete a Feature Selection to make sure what I am using is the best options
Look at different ways of handeling my missing values instead of just dropping them
Look in to using one hot encouding or different ways of encouding the catagorical data in palces like the decition tree, remove this from each of the learning algarythms and instead create a new file that kicks back the encouded file
The bagging has several errors such as style errors that needs to be revisted, even if innacurate for this data it may not be as the data grows, so needs to be improved
add comments throughout data
Write code to tune the hyperperamaters 
Create a code that imports a model then makes predictions from new new data
